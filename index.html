      My name is Christopher Manthey. I am a student here at Eastern Washington University and started in 2014. I am a VCD major, and hope to graduate with a Bacholor’s Degree in Arts. Cheerleading is my sport, and I’m on the cheerleading team here at eastern. I cheer on the sidelines of football, basketball, and volleyball games. Throughout grade school , I did competition cheer, and my team made it all the way to the Cheerleading World’s Championship in Orlando. I’m very experienced in tumbling. I’ve become fairly well-known at this school for being the red-headed kid that does backflips at basketball games.
